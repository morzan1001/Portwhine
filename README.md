# portwhine
Portwhine is a customizable software for monitoring and automated checking of IT assets. The project is based on 3 pillars. The input containers are event triggers that initiate a check of a resource, the handler is the brain of the whole operation and the workers are the actual test containers that generate extended data for an event.
