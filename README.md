Portwhine is a software for automatically checking assets, especially on the web. The idea is that there are certain input triggers which then trigger a check by various tools. These tools all run in docker containers and are started up and shut down on the fly as required. Results are stored in an elastic search database and can be analyzed via kibana. There is also an API that can be used to make configurations.
